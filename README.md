Bayesian Multitask learning with lasso

We propose a drug recommendation model that integrates information from both structured data (patient demographic information) and unstructured texts (patient reviews). It is based on multitask learning to predict review ratings of several satisfaction-related measures for a given medicine, where related tasks can learn from each other for prediction. The learned models can then be applied to new patients for drug recommendation. 
The main file is BML_drug1_compare.R which calls functions from other library to run a cluster different methods.
